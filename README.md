# Research Models for Hydrogel-Textile Composites

This is the research repository for `Hydrogel-Textile Composites: Actuators for Shape-Changing Interfaces`. It contains the 3D model files (STLs) to set-up the hot-end mount and fan mount for the hydrogel printer characterized in the associated publication. [More information about the work can be found here](https://mikeriv.com/research/hydrogel-textile-composites/).
